# carfree-accessible-trails

Open datasets of trails accessible by public transit and other car-free means.

## How the data is organized

Data is organized by region or by US National Forest. Within the lowest level location directory (e.g. Angeles_National_Forest or Los_Angeles_Area), the subfolders correspond to the original trail data source. 

Trail data came from the following sources:

- OSM: data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) via [Geofabrik OSM Data Extracts](http://download.geofabrik.de/)
- Transportation_L: obtained from [USFS National Datasets](https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php)
- RecreationSites: provided by Mount-Baker Snoqualmie National Forest
- TrailNFS: provided by Mount-Baker Snoqualmie National Forest
- CPAD: Land management agencies added based on [CPAD](http://www.calands.org/) for /City_Regions/United_States/CA/Los_Angeles_Area/OSM_trailheads_CPAD_Feb-24-2017_analysis.csv dataset.
